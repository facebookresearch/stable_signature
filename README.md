## Setup


### Requirements

First, clone the repository locally and move inside the folder:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/stable_signature
cd stable_signature
```
To install the main dependencies, we recommand using conda, and install the remaining dependencies with pip:
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) can be installed with:
```cmd
conda install -c pytorch torchvision pytorch==1.12.0 cudatoolkit==11.3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This codebase has been developed with python version 3.8, PyTorch version 1.12.0, CUDA 11.3.


### Models and data

#### Data

The paper uses the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) dataset to fine-tune the LDM decoder (we filtered images containing people).
All you need is around 500 images for training (preferably over 256x256).

#### Watermark models

The watermark extractor model can be downloaded in the following links.
The `.pth` file has not been whitened, while the `.torchscript.pt` file has been and can be used without any further processing. 
We additionally provide another extractor model, which has been trained with blur and rotations and has better robustness to that kind of attacks, at the cost of a slightly lower image quality (you might need to adjust the perceptual loss weight at your convenience).

| Model | Checkpoint | Torch-Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extractor | [dec_48b.pth](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/dec_48b.pth) | [dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt)  |
| Other | [other_dec_48b_whit.pth](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/other_dec_48b.pth) | [other_dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt) |

The following code automatically downloads the models and put them in the `models` folder:
```cmd
mkdir models
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt -P models/
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/other_dec_48b_whit.torchscript.pt -P models/
```

Code to train the watermark models is available in the folder called `hidden/`.

#### Perceptual Losses

The perceptual losses are based on [this repo](https://github.com/SteffenCzolbe/PerceptualSimilarity/).
You should download the weights here: https://github.com/SteffenCzolbe/PerceptualSimilarity/tree/master/src/loss/weights, and put them in a folder called `losses` (this is used in [src/loss/loss_provider.py#L22](https://github.com/facebookresearch/stable_signature/blob/main/src/loss/loss_provider.py#L22)).
To do so you can run 
```
git clone https://github.com/SteffenCzolbe/PerceptualSimilarity.git
cp -r PerceptualSimilarity/src/loss/weights src/loss/losses/
rm -r PerceptualSimilarity
```


## Usage

### Watermark pre-training

Please see [hidden/README.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/stable_signature/tree/main/hidden/README.md) for details on how to train the watermark encoder/extractor.

### Fine-tune LDM decoder

```
python finetune_ldm_decoder.py --num_keys 1 \
    --msg_decoder_path path/to/msg/decoder/ckpt.torchscript.pt \
    --train_dir path/to/train/dir \
    --val_dir path/to/val/dir
```

This code should generate: 
- *num_keys* checkpoints of the LDM decoder with watermark fine-tuning (checkpoint_000.pth, etc.),
- `keys.txt`: text file containing the keys used for fine-tuning (one key per line),
- `imgs`: folder containing examples of auto-encoded images.

[Params of LDM fine-tuning used in the paper](https://justpaste.it/aw0gj)  
[Logs during LDM fine-tuning](https://justpaste.it/cse0x)

### Generate

Reload weights of the LDM decoder in the Stable Diffusion pipeline:
```python
from diffusers.models import AutoencoderKL
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model)

state_dict = torch.load(path/to/ldm/checkpoint_000.pth)['ldm_decoder']
msg = pipe.vae.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
print(f"loaded LDM decoder state_dict with message\n{msg}")
print("you should check that the decoder keys are correctly matched")

device = torch.device('cuda')
pipe.to(device)
img = pipe("the cat drinks milk.").images[0]
img.save('output/image.png')
```

For instance with: [WM weights of SD2 decoder](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ssl_watermarking/sd2_decoder.pth), the weights obtained after running [this command](https://justpaste.it/ae93f). In this case, the state dict only contains the 'ldm_decoder' key, so you only need to load with `state_dict = torch.load(path/to/ckpt.pth)`


### Decode and Evaluate

The `decode.ipynb` notebook contains a full example of the decoding and associated statistical test.

The `run_evals.py` script can be used to get the robustness and quality metrics on a folder of images.
For instance:
```
python run_evals.py --eval_imgs False --eval_bits True \
    --img_dir path/to/imgs_w \
    --key_str '111010110101000001010111010011010100010000100111'
```
will return a csv file containing bit accuracy for different attacks applied before decoding.

```
python run_evals.py --eval_imgs True --eval_bits False \
    --img_dir path/to/imgs_w --img_dir_nw path/to/imgs_nw 
```
will return a csv file containing image metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) between watermarked (`_w`) and non-watermarked (`_nw`) images.
